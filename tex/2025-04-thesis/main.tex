  Working with substitutions for syntax with binders is a recurring aspect of
  programming language formalization. However, defining and reasoning about
  substitutions, renamings, and their associated laws is often repetitive and
  tedious.

  We present an Agda framework that automatically derives the substitution
  infrastructure for intrinsically scoped, multi-sorted syntax with binders. From
  a single syntax definition, our library derives renaming and substitution
  operations along with corresponding equational laws.

  Our approach is inspired by Autosubst 2 for Coq, which also derives equational
  laws based on the confluent and terminating \(\sigma\)-calculus rewriting
  system for terms with substitutions. We differ in three ways: we treat renaming
  and substitution uniformly via a generic traversal based on McBride’s Kit
  abstraction, derive equational laws using reflection instead of external code
  generation, and use Agda’s \texttt{REWRITE} mechanism to embed suitable proven
  equations as custom computation rules instead of relying on tactics.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Formalizing programming languages with binders requires careful treatment of
variable binding, substitution, and renaming. While conceptually
straightforward, these operations are notoriously tedious and repetitive to
define and reason about.

This work presents an Agda framework that automatically derives the
substitution infrastructure and standard lemmas needed to work with
intrinsically scoped syntax involving binders.

Intrinsically scoped syntax encodes variable binding and scope information
directly in the type of the syntax definition, unlike extrinsically scoped
approaches, where well-formedness is enforced through additional extrinsic
predicates on the syntax. It sits between extrinsically scoped syntax and
intrinsically typed syntax (i.e.\ encode both scope and typing information in
the type of the syntax), ensuring that terms are well scoped by construction
without committing to the full complexity of typing.

Given a syntax definition as an intrinsically scoped, multi-sorted data type,
where all syntactic categories are encoded uniformly within a single indexed
type, our library derives operations and lemmas for parallel renamings /
substitutions, allowing multiple variables to be substituted simultaneously in
a single traversal.

Our approach is inspired by Autosubst 2, a library that solves the problem for
de Bruijn representations in Coq. Like Autosubst, we derive equations inspired
by the \(\sigma\)-calculus, a confluent and terminating rewriting system for
terms with substitutions. However, unlike Autosubst, we make use of Agda’s
\texttt{REWRITE} mechanism to embed selected equational lemmas as custom
computation rules instead of proving a tactic based solver. This allows
equational laws to be applied automatically during reduction.

Another difference is that our system treats renaming and substitution
uniformly using the Kit abstraction, originating from work by McBride. In this
approach, renaming and substitution are instances of a single generic traversal
function that pushes a mapping (from variables to variables or terms) through a
term. This traversal is structurally recursive and guaranteed to preserve
scope.

\subsection*{Contributions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \cref{sec:multi} shows how to embed a suitable variant of the
        sigma calculus into Agda using rewrite rules, explained through the example of System F.

  \item \cref{sec:agdasubst} provides an overview of \texttt{Agdasubst} along with examples,
        explaining how to automatically derive all relevant equations for intrinsically scoped,
        multi-sorted syntax using reflection~\cite{saffrich:LIPIcs.ITP.2024.32}
        or generic syntax~\cite{allais2021typescopesafeuniverse}.

  \item In \cref{sec:intrinsic}, we investigate the intrinsically \emph{typed} setting.
        We observe that reasoning about substitutions at deeper levels of the indexing
        hierarchy substantially simplifies, but also requires an intuitive extension of
        the rule set.

\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:preliminaries}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Agda and its rewrite mechanism, which enables the embedding of custom
        $\beta$-reduction rules.
  \item Explicit substitutions, in particular the $\sigma_{SP}$-calculus, a terminating
        and confluent rewrite system for terms with substitutions.
  \item We present multi-sorted syntaxes and substitutions, along with abstractions
        over both, including generic scoped
        syntaxes~\cite{allais2021typescopesafeuniverse} and Kit abstractions that unify
        substitutions and renamings~\cite{stronglytyped,ren-sub}.

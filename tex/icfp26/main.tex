\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

When formalizing the metatheory of a programming language in a proof
assistant based on dependent type theory, variable binders are often
represented by de Bruijn indices. In some proof assistants, notably in
Agda, it is not uncommon to go an extra step and use intrinsically
typed syntax. This idea goes back to Curry-style vs.\ Church-style
formalizations of lambda calculus: the former style has an untyped
semantics and typing is externally imposed; in the latter style, it is
impossible to construct untyped terms and semantics is only assigned
to typed terms. Thus, untyped syntax gives rise to a Curry-style
presentation, whereas intrinsically typed syntax results in a
Church-style presentation.

The simply-typed lambda calculus provides an appealing example where
intrinsically typed syntax works well. \Cref{fig:simply-typed-syntax}
shows typical definitions of the 
syntax of types, type contexts, variables, and expressions, which are
indexed by contexts and types (left column). Building on these definitions it is
straightforward to define denotational or operational
semantics. Proving type safety for a small-step operational semantics
is also easy as subject reduction holds by definition and progress
follows by a simple inductive proof (right column). The style of these
definitions is adapted from the textbook by
\citet{DBLP:journals/scp/KokkeSW20}. We elide the definition  of the
substitution operator $\_[\_]$, as we discuss substitutions in detail
in \cref{sec:types}.

However, managing intrinsically typed syntax can become significantly
more demanding. For example, \citet{10.1007/978-3-030-33636-3_10}
present a formalization of System $F_\omega$, which is inspired by
prior work of \citet{DBLP:conf/csl/AltenkirchR99},
\citet{DBLP:phd/ethos/Chapman09}, and
\citet{DBLP:conf/cpp/Allais0MM17}. \citet{10.1007/978-3-030-33636-3_10}
start by defining kinds,
kind contexts, type variables, and type expressions, which are
isomorphic to the simply-typed lambda calculus, followed by the
development of type renamings and simultaneous type substitutions
\cite{DBLP:journals/jar/BentonHKM12}. On top of this type framework,
they define type contexts, expression variables, and expressions,
again followed by renaming and simultaneous substitution on
expressions. Crucially, expression renamings are indexed by type
renamings and expression substitution by type substitutions in their
framework. While indexing works smoothly for these definitions,
it complicates the proofs of some properties with uninteresting type
corrections, aka transfer hell.

Transfer hell is the colloquial term for being forced to apply
type-changing lemmas to terms that are already known to be equal. This
situation is annoying because proof assistants like Agda plainly
refuse to let users even state this equality.\footnote{A situation
  that can be addressed using heterogeneous equality introduced in
  Conor McBride's thesis.} A workaround is to state definitions and
proofs with explicit equivalence relations, but this practice is
cumbersome, inefficient, and far away from the holy grail of
definitional equality, which just works.

In this paper, we examine the transfer hell arising by
intrinsically-typed syntax encodings of System-F and
System-F$\omega$. Specifically, we consider the problems arising with
type-renaming-indexed renamings and type-substitution-indexed
substitutions. We propose to install the laws of the sigma calculus as
definitional equalities for type substitutions, thus simplifying
substitutions with the same approach like the tactics of Autosubst
\cite{schafer2015autosubst,Stark:2020:Mechanising,10.1145/3293880.3294101},
but automatically by rewriting \cite{10.1145/3434341}. We build on a
standard functional representation of renamings and substitutions
\cite{DBLP:journals/jar/BentonHKM12}, prove the lemmas underlying the
equational laws of the sigma calculus, and then inject these equations
into Agda's rewrite engine, i.e., make the sigma calculus equations
definitional (for type substitutions). The tricky part of this injection is to
obtain a confluent and terminating rewrite system in connection with
the existing definitional equalities.

We first exercise this program for plain System-F in \cref{sec:system-f}
and then apply the same techniques to System-F$\omega$ in
\cref{sec:system-fomega}. In the latter, the main difference to
previous work \cite{10.1007/978-3-030-33636-3_10} lies in our
intrinsic treatment of type conversion, which leads to significant
simplifications.

1. intrinsically typed syntax where substitution appears as an operation on th index leads to transfer hell.

INSERT MORE STORY ABOUT THIS ISSUE 
-> strictification paper? system f logrel paper?

2. the sigma calculus provides a confluent, terminating normalization approach, already used to generate prop eq. 

-> AUTOSUBST STORY 

3. if we use this decision procedure to generate def eq, we solve the transfer hell problem

4. for consistency, we need both the full computational behaviour and symbolic behaviour of substitutions (for adherence to rewrite rule restrictions)

5. use combination of opaque + REWRITE for 
approach that preserves logical consistency

-> 4. and 5. == SHORT VERSION OF MY PAPER

6. rewrite the sigma calculus on types

7. avoid transfer hell inside proofs for expressions 
  (here monad laws for expression substitution)

8. can we use this for type theory in type theory?
